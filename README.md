# CDK8s: A Simple Approach to Deploy Kubernetes Imperatively

This repository contains code examples and resources related to the article **CDK8s: A Simple Approach to Deploy Kubernetes Imperatively** [I wrote here](https://tatenda.hashnode.dev/cdk8s-a-simple-approach-to-deploy-kubernetes-imperatively).

## Overview

CDK8s (Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes) is a powerful tool that simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes resources using familiar programming languages such as Python, TypeScript, or Java. This repository provides practical examples and code snippets to help you understand and implement CDK8s for deploying Kubernetes applications imperatively.
